Sign
An NFTs’ sign is randomly assigned during minting. The sign indicates its unusual skill that can be used during play (listed below, each has a specified limited amount of times they can be cast during play). Signs also help determine whether NFTs will get along with each other better or not based on each others’ signs (note: there are some outliers!, randomized). Certain day(s) will give sign(s) extra benefits (balanced but randomized?)

2 - Can give their partner a temporary action speed bonus when cast
3 - Can teleport / switch spots with their partner when cast 
4 - Can emit water to put out fires
5 - Has a higher chance to get extra tips on orders
6 - Has higher chance of orders with high patience rating

Backgrounds
Tombstones / Backgrounds are randomly assigned during minting. Tombstones give coin/xp earning multipliers during gameplay. Each tombstone has a short funny epitaph regarding the NFTs death. Each death / epitaph is unique. RIP

Items/Gifts
Items can be earned in games, events or purchased in the marketplace. They can be used directly on NFTs, sold, given as gifts or used in-game.

Relationship Bonds
NFTs with the highest bond relationships can be matched together- matching them together makes something mysterious happen~~~~ Relationship bonds can be raised by:

Spending time together in designated areas together while the player(s) are away (could be similar to the third party contracts that pet owners Aavegotchis periodically for ghst token)
Playing games or participating in events together
Giving gifts
